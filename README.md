# Face Mask Recognition System
This AI system is built on two Convolutionary Neural Network Models.  
The distinction comes with the dataset type utilized; Binary and multi-class datasets.  
The binary datasets consist of **Masked** and **Unmasked** class labels, while the multi-class datasets consist of **Masked Correctly**, **Masked Incorrectly** and **Unmasked**.
