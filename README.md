# Face Mask Recognition System 😷

This project implements an AI-based face mask recognition system using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** 🧠.

The system supports **both binary and multi-class classification**, depending on the dataset used:

- **Binary Classification**
  - Masked
  - Unmasked

- **Multi-Class Classification**
  - Masked Correctly
  - Masked Incorrectly
  - Unmasked

A transfer learning approach based on **MobileNetV2** is used to improve performance while keeping the model efficient and lightweight.  
The trained model can be deployed for real-time or embedded computer vision applications.
